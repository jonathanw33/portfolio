# Counter Fix Instructions

I've identified and fixed the issue with the counter numbers showing "0+" instead of their correct values.

## The Problem
The animation code for the counters is setting all values to "0+" when the page loads, and then animating them up to their target values. However, it seems the animation isn't triggering correctly.

## The Solution
I've created a new script file `counter-fix.js` that directly sets the counter values to their correct values:
- Projects Done: 6+
- Years of Experience: 1+
- Education: ITB

## How to Implement the Fix

**Add this line to your index.html file**, just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script src="assets/js/counter-fix.js"></script>
```

This will ensure your counter values are displayed correctly, even if the animation doesn't trigger.

## Technical Details

The fix works by:
1. Setting the correct values directly via JavaScript
2. Adding a 'counter-fixed' class to prevent these elements from being animated
3. Overriding the intersection observer to still animate other counters but skip these fixed ones

This approach ensures your values are always correct while maintaining animations for any other counters you might add in the future.

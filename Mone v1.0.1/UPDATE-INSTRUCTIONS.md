# Portfolio Update Instructions

To make the "What I Do" section texts visible by default (without needing to hover), I've made the following changes:

1. Updated `assets/css/section-transitions.css` to make the `.reveal-element` class visible by default:
   - Changed `opacity: 0;` to `opacity: 1;`
   - Changed `transform: translateY(20px);` to `transform: translateY(0);`

2. Created a new script file `assets/js/service-text-fix.js` that makes all service text elements visible by default with JavaScript.

## Final Step Needed

Please add the new script to your index.html file by adding this line before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script src="assets/js/service-text-fix.js"></script>
```

This will ensure that all the text in your "What I Do" section is visible by default, while still maintaining the nice hover effects that enhance the items when you mouse over them.

## What Changed

Before: Service texts were hidden until you hovered over them
After: Service texts are visible by default, and get subtle enhancements on hover

The hover effects are still there, but now they just add a slight scaling and brightness boost instead of revealing the content.
